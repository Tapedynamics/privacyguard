"""
Celery application for sending tasks from the FastAPI backend.

This module defines a Celery instance configured via environment variables.
It does not register any tasks itself; tasks are defined in the `worker`
package. The backend uses this instance to enqueue longâ€‘running operations
without blocking HTTP requests.
